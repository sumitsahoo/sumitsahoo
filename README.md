### 💬 Greetings User 😎
Wondering who I am ? Well I am just a nerd who loves to code and play games :) I hate patents and love open-source.

### 🔭 What I am up-to now ?
Learning GCP, Docker and Strapi CMS while also experimenting with my brand new Raspberry Pi 4B. Flutter changed the way we code now a days (i.e. Declarative style) and everyone is adopting the same, is this the end for React Native ? Having exposed to Flutter I certainly wouldn’t prefer JS over Dart. Having said that, Android will always be close to heart 🤓

### 📱 Apps developed by me
Well, mostly I architect the solution and develop enterprise based apps. So unless you work for same company as I do, you won't be able to view all the apps that I was involved in. You can still see a few that I developed as a hobby :  [Personal Play Store Account](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Sumit%20Sahoo)
