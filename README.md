### 🤝🏻 Greetings

Hello there! As an architect, I specialize in designing and developing enterprise-level software applications that cater to the unique needs of businesses. I place great emphasis on creating scalable and secure solutions that address the specific needs of corporate clients. I hold a deep-seated appreciation for open-source technologies, which offer a collaborative and inclusive approach to software development. I believe that leveraging the principles of open-source can promote innovation, knowledge-sharing, and better outcomes for clients.

### 🔭 What I am up-to now ?
I am currently experimenting with a range of innovative technologies, such as Custom ChatGPT/PaLM Model (using Langchain, Llama Index, and Enterprise data ahem ahem ...), GCP, AWS Amplify, Docker, and Strapi CMS. Additionally, I am exploring the capabilities of my new Raspberry Pi 4B. The emergence of Flutter has revolutionized modern coding with its declarative style, leading to widespread adoption. However, this raises questions about the future of React Native. Personally, I have found Flutter to be a preferable alternative to React Native, thanks to its use of Dart instead of JS. Nevertheless, my passion for Android remains unwavering. 🤓

### 📱 Apps developed by me
Well, mostly I architect the solution and develop enterprise based apps. So unless you work for same company as I do, you won't be able to view all the apps that I was involved in. You can still see a few that I developed as a hobby:  [Personal Play Store Account](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Sumit%20Sahoo)
