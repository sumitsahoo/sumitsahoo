### ðŸ”­ What I am up-to now ?
I am currently experimenting with a range of innovative technologies, such as GCP, AWS Amplify, Docker, and Strapi CMS. Additionally, I am exploring the capabilities of my new Raspberry Pi 4B. The emergence of Flutter has revolutionized modern coding with its declarative style, leading to widespread adoption. However, this raises questions about the future of React Native.
