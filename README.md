### 🤝🏻 Greetings

Hello there! As an architect, I specialize in designing and developing enterprise-level software applications that cater to the unique needs of businesses. I place great emphasis on creating scalable and secure solutions that address the specific needs of corporate clients. I hold a deep-seated appreciation for open-source technologies, which offer a collaborative and inclusive approach to software development. I believe that leveraging the principles of open-source can promote innovation, knowledge-sharing, and better outcomes for clients.

### 📱 Apps developed by me
Well, mostly I architect the solution and develop enterprise based apps. So unless you work for the same company as I do, you won't be able to view all the apps that I was involved in. You can still see a few that I developed as a hobby:  [Personal Play Store Account](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Sumit%20Sahoo)
